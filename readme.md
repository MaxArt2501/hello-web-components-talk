Hello, Web Components! ðŸ‘‹
=========================

Slides for a live chat with Fabio Biondi about Web Components. # slides, about 30 minutes.

Originally conceived for Fabio Biondi Twitch channel (in Italian), online, 2022-03-17.

Built on top of [P-Slides](https://github.com/MaxArt2501/p-slides)!

## Building

Node.js 10.x is required (actually it could work in Node 8 - haven't checked).

To start the presentation in development mode:

1. Clone the repository;
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run serve`

Or `npm run build` to just build it, then serve `/public` with your HTTP server of choice.

## Tests

... what?
